# Free-Design

The Boostrap free template was designed as One Page responsive theme for multi-purposes. The HTML CSS and JS are ready to be cloned or zipped from GitHub Scripterix.

# Download HTML CSS JS files and create your necessary changes. 

# If you prefer to work more conveniently try already configured gulp script and package.json with dependencies. Work with compiled Sass to CSS.
